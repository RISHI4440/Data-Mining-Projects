# Data Mining Vacant and Abandoned Buildings in Chicago

**Introduction:**
In any urban center across the globe, Vacant and Abandoned buildings present significant challenges, such as contributing to urban decay posing safety risks, and reducing property values. In response to these challenges, my proposed data mining project aims to unravel the complex narrative of vacant and abandoned buildings in Chicago, focusing on their impact on Housing Quality and finding Vacant properties owned by Individuals and Corporations. I am planning to do it by leveraging a comprehensive dataset provided by Chicagoâ€™s Administrative Hearings and Finance Dept.

**Dataset Description and Significance:**
The dataset at the heart of this project comprises detailed records of violations related to vacant and abandoned buildings, as reported by the Chicago administration. Each record in the dataset includes several key columns including Docket and Violation Numbers, Issued Date and Last Hearing Date, Issuing Department, Property Address, Violation Type, Entity or Person(s), Disposition Description, Financial s, and Geospatial Data. This dataset is significant for its depth and breadth, offering a rich foundation for analysis.

**Story to Tell and Importance:**
This project aims to unravel the complex narrative of vacant and abandoned buildings in Chicago, focusing on their impact on Housing Quality and analyzing vacant properties owned by Individuals and Corporate Companies. Moreover, by leveraging geospatial data, we can determine how these neglected properties contribute to the degradation of surrounding housing, while also exploring ownership patterns to understand their role in urban decay.
